    "## What is Numba?\n",
    "Numba is a just-in-time, type-specializing, function compiler for accelerating numerically-focused Python. That's a long list, so let's break down those terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __function compiler__: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions. Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function.\n",
    "* __type-specializing__: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using. Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow. In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
    "* __just-in-time__: Numba translates functions when they are first called. This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using. This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application.\n",
    "* __numerically-focused__: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like int, float, and complex. There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU. To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays."

Whilst the use of looplifting in object mode can enable some performance increase, getting functions to compile under no python mode is really the key to good performance. To make it such that only no python mode is used and if compilation fails an exception is raised the decorators @njit and @jit(nopython=True) can be used (the first is an alias of the second for convenience).\n",

Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, but 64-bit data types have a significant performance cost on the GPU. Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats.
